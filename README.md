# Bot Trading Logic

##  The bot calculates the **spread** between the **highest bid** and the **lowest ask prices** in the order book for a specified trading pair.

### When the spread exceeds your setup threshold, and it has been a set period since the last trade (cool-off period to avoid high-frequency trading), the bot will place a BUY order. 

### **Do NOT use this code for actual trading.**

### More functionality to come.
